//NOTES: Adding images
//I use two programs because I'm not fast with the 2nd program, or too
//lazy to become better at it. So this is the 'Lazy Chuck' method.

1. Use Paint.exe (Microsoft) to create graphic. Choose following sizes:
    24x24 - notifications
	32x32 - action bar
	16x16 - contextual
	48x48 - launcher icon (icon showing on desktop)
	72x72 - icons for buttons

    Transparency will be added next. Ensure transparent areas are a solid
    color that is not used within the image (e.g. magenta)

2. Save file. E.g. "ic_72x72_functionName.png"

3. Open same file in Paint.net. (Really easy to add transparency).
4. Use the 'Wand' tool and select a spot on the transparent color (e.g. magenta).
5. Delete. This removes all magenta and reveals a checkered background.
6. Append "_a" to the filename during 'save as'. The "_a" means alpha, or indicates
   the png file has transparency.
7. Close the file.
8. Drag the file into the 'res\drawable-hdpi' folder in the Eclipse project.

9. In Eclipse, select the "res\layout" file that will utilize the image.
10. For this explanation, the image will be used as an icon and placed on top
    of a button. Assume the button is named "buttonEmail" and the image is
    named "ic_72x72_email_a.png". The following XML code is sufficient.

	NOTE the background and drawableTop properties.


            <Button
                android:id="@+id/buttonEmail"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
                android:layout_gravity="left"
                android:background="@android:color/transparent"
                android:drawableTop="@drawable/ic_72x72_email_a"
                android:onClick="sendEmail" />
	
11. Add the XML code and save the button.
12. Click the 'Graphical Layout' mode and see the new image in use.

EDITING the image. You can open the original file saved in Windows Explorer and make changes.
Perform steps 1 through 8 above. That's all.
